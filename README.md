> Correlate http requests across microservices built with [micro](https://github.com/zeit/micro).


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tafarij/micro-correlation-id.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tafarij/micro-correlation-id) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/tafarij/micro-correlation-id/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/tafarij/micro-correlation-id?branch=master) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/micro-correlation-id.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/micro-correlation-id) [![XO code style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-XO-5ed9c7.svg)](https://github.com/xojs/xo)

This a [micro](https://github.com/zeit/micro) module for setting a [correlation id](https://blog.rapid7.com/2016/12/23/the-value-of-correlation-ids/) per HTTP request. The correlation id associated with a request remains consistent across async calls made within the scope of the request handler.

This module is inspired by [express-correlation-id](https://github.com/toboid/express-correlation-id) and makes use of [cls-hooked](https://github.com/jeff-lewis/cls-hooked)

## Installation
```bash
# npm
npm i -S micro-correlation-id

# or yarn
yarn add micro-correlation-id
```

## Usage
```javascript
const {correlator, getId} = require('micro-correlation-id');
const assert = require('assert');

module.exports = correlator()(async (req, res) => {
  // These values will always be the same within this scope
  assert.equal(req.correlationId(), getId());
  res.end();
})
```

## API
### `correlator(idHeader='x-correlation-id')`

This creates and/or sets the correlation id on each incomming request. If the incoming request has a correlation id then that id is preserved, a new uuid is assigned otherwise. The correlation id may be accessed using `req.correlationId()` or `getId()`.

`correlator` takes and optional argument `idHeader` which defaults to `x-correlation-id`. This is HTTP header key used for passing a correlation id. You may change this to your liking.

### `getId()`
Use this to get the current correlation id from any where within a request handler. It will always be equivalent to `req.correlationId()`.
